Data structures and algorithms

The course is used to introduce the complexity of algorithms and methods of its estimation. It discusses the basics of mathematical induction, recursive algorithms, typical examples of data structures, sorting and searching algorithms. As a complement, NP-completeness and related problems are discussed.


The aim of the course is to teach students to compute estimates of the complexity of algorithms, to prove statements by mathematical induction, to be able to compare the complexity of different solutions, and to navigate NP-completeness and related problems.
